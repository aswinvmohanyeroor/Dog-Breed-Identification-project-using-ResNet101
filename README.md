# 🐶 Dog Breed Identification using ResNet101

## 📌 Project Overview
This project fine-tunes the **ResNet101** convolutional neural network for **dog breed classification** using **transfer learning**. The model is trained on the **Dog Breed Identification dataset** from Kaggle, leveraging **PyTorch** for implementation. Data augmentation techniques and optimization strategies like **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** and **early stopping** are used to improve accuracy and generalization.

## 🚀 Features
- **ResNet101-based Model:** Uses a pre-trained model for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
- **Transfer Learning:** Adapts a model trained on ImageNet to the dog breed classification task.
- **Data Augmentation:** Includes random resizing, rotation, flipping, and color jittering.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Submission to Kaggle:** Generates predictions for final evaluation.
